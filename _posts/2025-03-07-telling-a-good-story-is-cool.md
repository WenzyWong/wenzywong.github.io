This week's work has been truly fascinating. 

Today I'm due to present a work report at our weekly group meeting, and I've decided to formally introduce the tool I've spent months developing. I gave myself a day to prepare from scratch, having focused the past few days on writing the main text for a brief article about this tool. Both tasks are rather unfamiliar to me, as I've never attempted such concise writing before, nor have I any experience introducing a bioinformatics tool. I spent an entire day reading and browsing brief articles. Whilst writing, I discovered that the more concise an article is, the higher the demand for precision, significance and logical coherence of each sentence. I quite enjoy this challenge, as it has begun to form a logical framework and knowledge filter in my mind, aiding my writing process.

During the composition of the main text, I've also kept the project presentation in mind. The timing is ideal. After completing my draft, I could reconsider how to reorganise the background story of this tool, as I would then be standing from an audience's perspective to re-examine why and how the tool was developed. Combining the logic of the article's main text with the presentation approach is like constructing a wonderful debate in my own head.

Before starting on my slides, I tried to recall presentations from seminars and symposia that had greatly impressed me. These speakers seemed to possess their own understanding of a subject, with clear and logical thinking underpinning the background stories. Each piece of introduction was somehow closely related to their thinking, without superfluous content. I believe that's why I found their presentations superior to those with abundant background knowledge that often obscures the main thinking. Delivering a good presentation isn't about showcasing the breadth of one's knowledge in a certain field, but rather selectively presenting the most important and relevant information that will help the audience follow each nuance of thought point by point.

Indeed, that's the goal I wished to achieve in my presentation. Simply listing important former discoveries and drawing a comprehensive map of the field would be both boring and tedious. I needed to develop my own approach to 'sell' my tool-development story and select the most suitable research to serve my narrative, rather than allowing those breakthrough discoveries to obscure my intention.

I selected the research very carefully, considering not only its importance in the field but also extracting the most relevant information to support the story of 'my considerations'. This took considerably more time than simply listing breakthrough background research, and even more than constructing the results slides. But it was thoroughly worthy.

After I finished presenting the 'introduction' section, my adviser paused me momentarily and praised how I had structured the background knowledge alongside my own thoughts. He also suggested I could write the article following the structure of my slides (in fact, I had already completed my writing, with similar logic). I was pleased to hear this and to find that someone appreciated the point of my reconstruction and enjoyed the story I was 'selling'.

The narrative I shared wasn't exactly what I had envisioned at the project's outset. Initially, it was far less clear. I sorted things out gradually throughout the development process, rather than imagining the relationships and questions I presented today. It's a sort of pulse discovered in hindsight, rather than a blueprint predicted from the start. The storytelling aspect was quite tricky, but also fulfilling. I suppose it's because I sensed that I was gradually creating meaning through my study, even if I wasn't entirely certain at first. This meaning is wholly constructed by my own logic, which means a great deal.

Telling a good story is really coolâ€”I thought of it while listening to other remarkable speakers and still thought so after I finished my presentation. It's not about tricking people into believing why and how you do your work, but giving yourself a sense of feeling that you are doing an interesting work with beautiful logic. (Is it a type of self-deceiving? But it feels good.)
