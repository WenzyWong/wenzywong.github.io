      <p>Welcome to my personal blog. My given name is Yunzhe WANG. You may also address me by my Cantonese-inspired phonetic name, Wenzy WONG. In this blog, you'll find my thoughts on scientific research. Below is a brief summary of my educational background and academic journey over the past few years. </p>
      <p>I hold a Bachelor&#39;s degree in Bioinformatics from <a href="https://encoi.hzau.edu.cn/">the College of Informatics</a>, <a href="https://en.hzau.edu.cn/">Huazhong Agricultural University</a>, where I developed both data-driven and question-driven thinking. I furthered my medical research experience through a visiting research programme, Biological and Biomedical Science Programme, at <a href="https://www.sls.cuhk.edu.hk/">School of Life Sciences</a>, <a href="https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/">The Chinese University of Hong Kong</a>. As the team leader, I guided our group, earning the second prize in the final presentation. </p>
      <p>Currently, I'm in my third year of a Successive Postgraduate and Doctoral Programme at <a href="https://zhanglab-fudan.github.io/">Zhang Lab</a>, <a href="https://basicmed.fudan.edu.cn/main.htm">School of Basic Medical Sciences</a>, <a href="https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/">Fudan University</a>. Throughout my doctoral studies, I have continued to strengthen my bioinformatics skills, especially focusing on their appropriate and effective applications in cancer research. My ongoing project examines microbial communities associated with gastrointestinal cancers through multi-omics data mining. My interests extend to other interdisciplinary areas and systems biology, which I consider a promising framework for future biological research. </p>
