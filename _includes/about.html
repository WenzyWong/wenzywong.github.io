      <p>Welcome to my personal blog. My name is Yunzhe Wang, and you may also address me by the Cantonese-inspired phonetic name, Wenzy Wong. Both are acceptable and reflect my given name.</p>
      <p>I am currently a third-year student in the combined Master&#39;s and Ph.D. programme at <a href="https://zhanglab-fudan.github.io/">Zhang Lab</a>, <a href="https://basicmed.fudan.edu.cn/main.htm">School of Basic Medical Sciences</a>, <a href="https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/">Fudan University</a>. </p>
      <p>Before the programme, I earned my Bachelor&#39;s degree in Bioinformatics at <a href="https://encoi.hzau.edu.cn/">College of Informatics</a>, <a href="https://en.hzau.edu.cn/">Huazhong Agricultural University</a>, where I systematically learned this field and developed both data-driven and question-driven thinking. Beyond traditional undergraduate studies, to compensate for the lack of exposure to medical research at an agricultural university, I also participated in a visiting research programme, Biological and Biomedical Science Programme, at <a href="https://www.sls.cuhk.edu.hk/">School of Life Sciences</a>, <a href="https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/">The Chinese University of Hong Kong</a>. The group I led there won the second price in the ending presentation of this programme. </p>
      <p>During my Ph.D. programme, I have continued to enhance bioinformatics skills, aiming to understand more of their effective applications in cancer-related studies. My current research focuses on utilizing multi-omics data to explore unique microbial communities associated with human gastrointestinal tract cancers. I am also deeply interested in interdisciplinary fields, such as the relationship between neuroactive substances and cancer, the impact of metabolites from various sources on epigenetic reprogramming, etc. </p>
